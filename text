Facebook Graph API requires HTTPS, so you'll need SAS/Secure for SSL connections
over HTTPS. This is a Facebook security requirement.

===Note about Paths===
The paths listed are intended to work on Linux, and on Ubuntu 13.10, installing groovy with sudo apt-get install groovy will install 1.8.6 into the stated path. If you are on windows, if you put the groovy-all.1.8.6 file at the path "C:\usr\share\groovy\lib\", SAS on Windows will find it. Similarly, you will need to have a folder "C:\tmp\" in order to store intermediate files. As long as these two things exist, the code will work cross-platform.

3 ways of connecting:

Python script to CSV

Manually parse with SAS

Proc HTTP & Proc Groovy
